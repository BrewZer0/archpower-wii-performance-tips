            <p>I Use arch (on my wii) btw.<br>as an user of <a href="https://wii-linux.org">Wii Linux</a>, i've tried countless performance tips while also keeping a graphic enviroment, and i found some optimal settings for it too.<br>
             </p>
             <h2>What's archPOWER First of all?</h2>
             <p> <a href="https://archlinuxpower.org/">Arch POWER</a> is a port of the <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> distribution to 64 Bit PowerPC Machines and select RISC-V Machines. <br>y`know, the distro everyone glazes...<br> jokes aside, the wii got this port thanks to the work of Techflash to the <b>32-Bit Big Endian PowerPC Architecture (or just ppc32)</b>, including the 4.15 Kernel and is able to port other things, like requested apps (as long as they compile properly) from the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org">AUR</a>, the package manager and such, which is how i got most packages which are lightweight and minimal enough to run good on an almost driverless (at the moment, please write some drivers for the hollywood) enviroment.<br>no, i won`t give you a guide for installing it. <br> <a href="https://wiki.wii-linux.org/wiki/Installation_Guide">for the love of GOD, read the wiki for it.</a>  </p>
             <h2>Optimization tips</h2>
             <p>To the main topic of this small site, i will first provide you some <b>commands to optimize RAM Usage, and adding swap space and such</b>, then we will go to optimizing it also using a graphical interface. UPDATE: just now, they got LLVMPipe working on a Wii U. we'll see for the future how it will perform on the wii. hopefully we're able to run classicube at 3 FPS.  <br><br><a href="script.sh">Download this script on your Wii.</a> it will do this tweaks: 
             <li>
                 Change the file /etc/systemd/journald.conf to use 500K for logging, saves <b> 5 MB</b> of RAM.
                 
             </li><br>
             <li>
                Disables the service userdbd. not needed and uses Some CPU.
             </li><br>
             <li>
             Disables at-spi-dbus-bus, it's accessibility features you don't need at all. sucks up <b> 10 MB </b> When enabled.
             </li><br>
             <li>
                 Writes GTK_ALLY=none to the .xinitrc file.
               
             </li><br>
             <li>
                 Will create a 512 MB Swap file, add the permissions, make a swap file and add the lines to /etc/fstab to auto mount it at boot.
          
             </li><br>
             
             <li>
                 will fix an issue with the extra repository as it's been changed.
             </li><br>
after you executed the script, it will automatically reboot your wii.<br>now that you've done the essential tweaks, type configmii on the terminal after logging in, go to archPOWER settings and run a system update. if it fails, restart it again until it downloads everything. <br>
             </p>
             <h2>Package suggestions</h2>
             <p>Finally, what do i suggest using to having it look pretty much modern and also lean on RAM / CPU usage? <br>
<p> if you use tiling window managers, <b> Use i3 or dwm.</b> if you use stacking window managers, use <b> xorg-twm</b>, <b>jwm</b> or <b>tinywm</b> if you really want it very lean on usage. i suggest using jwm for this as it's the best choice if you want a stable and customizable Window manager. it also comes with a panel, so no need to install extra elements for it.<br> for the rest, you can use: <br><br> <b>File managers</b>: Midnight commander<br> <b>Web Browser</b>: dillo, w3m, elinks 
<br> <b>Text editor</b>: nano, vim <br>
<b>Terminal</b>: Suckless Terminal (st) or xterm<br>
<b>viewing images</b>: feh<br>
if you want, <a href="jwmconf.sh">You can download this script</a>  to install the suggested packages. <br>
